SBLIM WBEMSMT Samba EUI - README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wbemsmt-samba package provides the end user interface functionality to 
configure Samba via WBEM-SMT.


Source Package Contents
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The source package contains the following parts:
 ./README            This file
 ./AUTHORS           
 ./COPYING           
 ./NEWS              
 ./ChangeLog         
 ./build.xml         Apache Ant build file
 ./sblim-wbemsmt-samba.spec The RPM spec file
 ./java/*            Contains the java(tm) source files
 ./cli-scripts       Contains the shell scripts for CLI support
 ./conf              Contains the configuration files for generator tools


General Requirements
--------------------
In order to build, install and operate this package you will need a Java SDK 
or Run Time Environment depending on whether you build binaries from sources
or use the pre-built binaries (JAR file). The following Java JDKs are supported:

Sun Java SDK/JRE: version 1.5.0 or higher

IBM Java SDK/JRE: version 1.5.0 or higher

GNU Compile For Java: version 4.1.1 20061116 or higher


Build-time Prerequisites
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build tooling:
  - Apache Ant from http://ant.apache.org

The Binaries of the CVS Modules:
  - wbemsmt-commons
  - wbemsmt-webapp
or the Releases of the packages
  - sblim-wbemsmt-commons
  - sblim-wbemsmt-webapp

Third-Party Libraries (and their dependent jar-Files):
  - sblim-cim-client 1.3.2 from http://www.sblim.org/
  - Apache MyFaces 1.1.5 from http://myfaces.apache.org/
  - Jakarta-Commons Lang from http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/lang/
  - Jakarta-Commons CLI from http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cli/
  - XMLBeans 2.2.0 from http://xmlbeans.apache.org/


Run-time Preequisites
---------------------
To be able to run the task, the following AND their run-time dependencies
need to be installed properly into a Tomcat5 server:
  - sblim-wbemsmt-webapp 
  - sblim-wbemsmt-commons



Building this package
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The build process is based on Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org). It contains 
a build.xml that allows very easy to perform a compile, produce JAR files and 
build TAR balls for a binary or a source distribution.
Additionally, an RPM spec file is in place that allows to build RPM packages.
The output of the RPM build process are RPM packages that are based on the
JPackage (http://www.jpackage.org) approach.

To be able to perform the build, set the CLASSPATH to include the JAR files
of the packages described in the 'Build-time Prerequisites. Afterwards
a Source and a Binary TAR ball can easily be built by performing the following
command:
> ant build-release
The output will be placed in the './target/release' directory.

The Source TAR ball can also be created without setting the CLASSPATH by 
simply performing:
> ant package-src-tar

With the Source TAR ball, RPM packages can be build. Since the TAR ball already
includes the RPM spec file the execution of
> rpmbuild -ta sblim-wbemsmt-samba-<version>.src.tar.bz2
will directly build the RPM package. Be sure to solve the build requirements
before the build of the RPM package can take place. This is done when the 
dependent packages explained in the 'Build-time Prerequisites' have been
installed as RPM packages.


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The installation can be processed in two ways. 

The first possible installation flavour would be to use the RPM package. This
is of course our recommended way. Simply put the RPM package onto your system,
resolve the 'Run-time Dependencies' and then perform the following command:
> rpm -i sblim-wbemsmt-samba-<version>.1jpp.noarch.rpm

The second way is a manual installation. This means the Binary TAR ball should
be taken and extracted. Copy the JAR files into the 'WEB-INF/lib' directory of
the 'sblim-wbemsmt-webapp' in your tomcat installation directory and 
additionally copy the content of the 'etc' directory into the '/etc' directory.
If you like to run the Command Line Interface script, then you should copy
the script to a location which is included into your '$PATH' environment 
variable.

Afterwards restart the tomcat server to load the tasks functionality.


Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Firewall users: please ensure that port 8080 (or other port, depending on 
Tomcat's configuration) is enabled for inbound connections and that the 
standard WBEM/CIM port, 5988, is enabled for outbound connections

start Tomcat:
> service tomcat5 start

The EUI (End User Interface) can be accessed by typing the following URL into 
a web browser: http://hostname:port/sblim-wbemsmt-webapp where hostname needs 
to be replaced by the hostname of the system on which the above client packages 
were installed. The port number is typically 8080 but can vary, depending on 
Tomcat's configuration.

Once the EUI is started, in the Name field of the displayed screen enter the 
name of the host which on which the server package was installed. Typically 
the Port and Namepaces fields do not need to be changed. The User and the 
Password fields need to contain the OpenPegasus CIM user name and its password.

The application will initially take some time to populate the tree on the
browser with all the defined shares, printers and users. Existing samba shares,
printers and the users can be modified by selecting them, and editing the
properties. Samba shares, printers, and users can be created (or deleted) by
selecting the Shares, Printers and Users nodes and then selecting the create
(or delete) action at the top and then selecting the update node. 


Advanced Feature
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To enable the application to be able to multiple hosts in parallel, please 
refere to the 'MultipleHostsSupport' documentation file.

In case you encounter problems please refer to the TroubleShooting file. 



Un-Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the RPM package was installed, just perform
> rpm -e sblim-wbemsmt-samba
and things will get removed.

For manual un-installations, just remove the files you have copied into the
webapp environment and also remove the copied content of the 'etc' directory.

Afterwards please restart the tomcat server to unload the task.
